<h2>About Me</h2>   
<p>My names Ryan Baum, I live in Wichita, Kansas.</p>

<h3>Favorite Quote</h3>
<p>My favorite quote at the moment is actually a verse from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgement is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me"<p>
<p><cite>New International Version: John 5:30</cite><p>
